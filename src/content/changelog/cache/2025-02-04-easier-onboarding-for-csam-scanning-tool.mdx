You can now implement our **child safety tooling**, the **[CSAM Scanning Tool](/cache/reference/csam-scanning/)**, more easily. Instead of requiring external reporting credentials, you only need a verified email address for notifications to onboard. This change makes the tool more accessible to a wider range of customers.

## **How It Works**  

When enabled, the tool automatically [hashes images for enabled websites as they enter the Cloudflare cache](https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-csam-scanning-tool/). These hashes are then checked against a database of **known abusive images**.  

- **Potential match detected?**  
  - The **content URL is blocked**, and  
  - **Cloudflare will notify you** about the found matches via the provided email address.  

## **Updated Service-Specific Terms**  

We have also made updates to our **[Service-Specific Terms](https://www.cloudflare.com/service-specific-terms-application-services/#csam-scanning-tool-terms)** to reflect these changes.
