**Rules Overview** gives you a single page to manage all your [Cloudflare Rules](/rules/).

![Rules Overview Interface](~/assets/images/changelog/rules/rules-overview.gif)

What you can do:

- **See all your rules in one place** – No more clicking around.
- **Find rules faster** – Search by name.
- **Understand execution order** – See how rules run in sequence.
- **Debug easily** – Use [Trace](/fundamentals/trace-request/) without switching tabs.

Check it out in [Rules > Overview](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/rules/overview).
