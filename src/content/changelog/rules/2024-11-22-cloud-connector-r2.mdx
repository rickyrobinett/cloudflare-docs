Now, you can use [Cloud Connector](/rules/cloud-connector/) to route traffic to your [R2 buckets](/r2/) based on URLs, headers, geolocation, and more.

Example setup:

```bash
curl --request PUT \
"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/cloud_connector/rules" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '[
  {
    "expression": "http.request.uri.path wildcard \"/images/*\"",
    "provider": "cloudflare_r2",
    "description": "Connect to R2 bucket containing images",
    "parameters": {
      "host": "mybucketcustomdomain.example.com"
    }
  }
]'
```

Get started using [Cloud Connector](/rules/cloud-connector/) documentation.
