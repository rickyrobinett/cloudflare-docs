You can now transform HTML elements with streamed content using [`HTMLRewriter`](/workers/runtime-apis/html-rewriter).

Methods like `replace`, `append`, and `prepend` now accept [`Response`](/workers/runtime-apis/response/) and [`ReadableStream`](/workers/runtime-apis/streams/readablestream/)
values as [`Content`](/workers/runtime-apis/html-rewriter/#global-types).

This can be helpful in a variety of situations. For instance, you may have a Worker in front of an origin,
and want to replace an element with content from a different source. Prior to this change, you would have to load
all of the content from the upstream URL and convert it into a string before replacing the element. This slowed
down overall response times.

Now, you can pass the `Response` object directly into the `replace` method, and HTMLRewriter will immediately
start replacing the content as it is streamed in. This makes responses faster.

<TypeScriptExample filename="index.ts">
```ts
class ElementRewriter {
	async element(element: any) {
		// able to replace elements while streaming content
		// the fetched body is not buffered into memory as part
		// of the replace
		let res = await fetch('https://upstream-content-provider.example');
		element.replace(res);
	}
}

export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
		let response = await fetch('https://site-to-replace.com');
		return new HTMLRewriter().on('[data-to-replace]', new ElementRewriter()).transform(response);
	},
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```
</TypeScriptExample>
