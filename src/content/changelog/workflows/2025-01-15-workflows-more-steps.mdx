[Workflows](/workflows/) (beta) now allows you to define up to 1024 [steps](/workflows/build/workers-api/#workflowstep). `sleep` steps do not count against this limit.

We've also added:

* `instanceId` as property to the [`WorkflowEvent`](/workflows/build/workers-api/#workflowevent) type, allowing you to retrieve the current instance ID from within a running Workflow instance
* Improved queueing logic for Workflow instances beyond the current maximum concurrent instances, reducing the cases where instances are stuck in the queued state.
* Support for [`pause` and `resume`](/workflows/build/workers-api/#pause) for Workflow instances in a queued state.

We're continuing to work on increases to the number of concurrent Workflow instances, steps, and support for a new `waitForEvent` API over the coming weeks.
