Previously, all viewers watched "the live edge," or the latest content of the
broadcast, synchronously. If a viewer paused for more than a few seconds,
the player would automatically "catch up" when playback started again. Seeking
through the broadcast was only available once the recording was available after
it conluded.

Starting today, customers can make a small adjustment to the player
embed or manifest URL to enable the DVR experience for their viewers. By
offering this feature as an opt-in adjustment, our customers are empowered to
pick the best experiences for their applications.

When building a player embed code or manifest URL, just add `dvrEnabled=true` as
a query parameter. There are some things to be aware of when using this option.
