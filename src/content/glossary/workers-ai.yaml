  - term: Model Catalog
    general_definition: |-
      [Model Catalog](/workers-ai/models/) is a curated collection of AI models available within Workers AI, providing developers with a variety of pre-trained models for different tasks.
  - term: Fine-Tuning
    general_definition: |-
      [Fine-Tuning](/workers-ai/fine-tunes/) is a general term for modifying an AI model by continuing to train it with additional data.
  - term: LoRA Adapters
    general_definition: |-
      [LoRA Adapters](/workers-ai/fine-tunes/loras/) (Low-Rank Adaptation adapters) are used in machine learning to fine-tune models efficiently by adjusting a small number of parameters, allowing for customization of AI models in Workers AI.[Public LoRA Adapters](/workers-ai/fine-tunes/public-loras/) are pre-trained Low-Rank Adaptation adapters available for public use.
  - term: Function Calling
    general_definition: |-
      [Function Calling](/workers-ai/function-calling/) enables people to take Large Language Models (LLMs) and use the model response to execute functions or interact with external APIs.
  - term: AI models
    general_definition: |-
      [An AI model](/workers-ai/models) is a trained system that processes input data to generate predictions, decisions, or outputs based on patterns it has learned.
  - term: Workers KV
    general_definition: |-
      [Workers KV](/kv/)is a data storage that allows you to store and retrieve data globally.
  - term: D1
    general_definition: |-
