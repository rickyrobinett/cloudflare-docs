    title: Removal of unused DNS record meta fields
    description: |-
      Cloudflare is removing five fields from the `meta` object of DNS records.
      These fields have been unused for more than a year and are no longer set on new records.
      This change may take up to four weeks to fully roll out.
      The affected fields are:
      - the `auto_added` boolean
      - the `managed_by_apps` boolean and corresponding `apps_install_id`
      - the `managed_by_argo_tunnel` boolean and corresponding `argo_tunnel_id`

    title: Zone IDs and names on individual DNS records
    description: |-
      Records returned by the API will no longer contain the `zone_id` and `zone_name` fields.
      This change may take up to four weeks to fully roll out.
      The affected fields were deprecated with an End of Life (EOL) date of November 30, 2024.
