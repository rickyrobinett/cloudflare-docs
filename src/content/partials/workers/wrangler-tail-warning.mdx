When updating a Worker with Wrangler the [Tail Consumer](/workers/observability/logs/tail-workers) config will be removed. Please add the `tail\_consumers` config to the top level of your [Wrangler configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/).

<WranglerConfig>
```toml
tail_consumers = [{service = "<TAIL_WORKER_NAME>"}]
```
</WranglerConfig>
