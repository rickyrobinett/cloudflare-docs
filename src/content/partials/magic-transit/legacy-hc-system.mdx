For customers using the legacy health check system with a public IP range, Cloudflare recommends:

- Configuring the tunnel health check target IP address to one within the `172.64.240.252/30` prefix range.
- Applying a policy-based route that matches packets with a source IP address equal to the configured tunnel health check target (for example `172.64.240.253/32`), and route them over the tunnel back to Cloudflare.
