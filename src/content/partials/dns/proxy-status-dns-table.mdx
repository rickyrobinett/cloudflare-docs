<Example>

DNS management for **example.com**:

| Type |  Name  |   Content   | Proxy status |   TTL  |
| :--: | :----: | :---------: | :----------: | :----: |
|  A | `blog` | `192.0.2.1` |   Proxied  | Auto |
|  A | `shop` | `192.0.2.2` |  DNS only  | Auto |
</Example>

In the example DNS table above, there are two DNS records. The record with the name `blog` has proxy on, while the record named `shop` has the proxy off (that is, **DNS only**).
