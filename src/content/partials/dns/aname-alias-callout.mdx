ANAME or ALIAS are DNS records used by specific DNS providers. If your previous provider was using ANAME or ALIAS, you can recreate these records on Cloudflare as CNAME records. Cloudflare's [CNAME flattening](/dns/cname-flattening/)[^1] allows you to create CNAME records at your [zone apex](/dns/concepts/#zone-apex), removing the need for those other record types.

[^1]: A process in which Cloudflare returns an IP address instead of the target hostname that a CNAME record points to.
