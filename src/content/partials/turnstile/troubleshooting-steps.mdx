1. Verify your browser compatibility.
    - Turnstile supports all major browsers, except Internet Explorer.

2. Disable your browser extensions.
    - Some browser extensions, such as ad blockers, may block the scripts Turnstile needs to operate.
    - Temporarily disable all extensions and reload the page.
3. Enable JavaScript.
    - Turnstile requires JavaScript to run. Ensure it is enabled in your browser settings. Refer to your browser's documentation for instructions on enabling JavaScript.
4. Try Incognito or Private mode.
    - Use your browser's incognito or private mode to rule out issues caused by extensions or cached data.
5. Test another browser or device.
    - Switch to a different browser or device to see if the issue is specific to your current setup.
6. Avoid VPNs or proxies.
    - Some virtual private networks (VPN) or proxies may interfere with Turnstile. Disable them temporarily to test.
7. Switch to a different network.
    - Your current network may have restrictions causing Turnstile challenges to fail. Try switching to another network, such as a mobile hotspot.
