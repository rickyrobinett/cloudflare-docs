A Durable Object is a special kind of [Cloudflare Worker](/workers/) which uniquely combines compute with storage. Like a Worker, a Durable Object is automatically provisioned geographically close to where it is first requested, starts up quickly when needed, and shuts down when idle. You can have millions of them around the world. However, unlike regular Workers:

- Each Durable Object has a **globally-unique name**, which allows you to send requests to a specific object from anywhere in the world. Thus, a Durable Object can be used to coordinate between multiple clients who need to work together.
- Each Durable Object has some **durable storage** attached. Since this storage lives together with the object, it is strongly consistent yet fast to access.

Therefore, Durable Objects enable **stateful** serverless applications.
