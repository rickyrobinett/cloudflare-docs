## Create a list from a CSV file

To test uploading CSV lists, you can download a [sample CSV file](/cloudflare-one/static/list-test.csv) of IP address ranges or copy the following into a file:

```csv title="list-test.csv"
value,description
192.0.2.0/24,This is an IP address range in CIDR format
198.51.100.0/24,This is also an IP address range
203.0.113.0/24,This is the third IP address range

```

When you format a CSV file for upload:

- Each line should be a single entry that includes a value and an optional description.
- A header row must be present for Zero Trust to recognize descriptions.
- Trailing whitespace characters are not allowed.
- CRLF (Windows) and LF (Unix) line endings are valid.

To upload the list to Zero Trust:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **My Team** > **Lists**.
2. Select **Upload CSV**.
3. Next, specify a **List name**, enter an optional description, and choose a **List type**.
4. Drag and drop a file into the **CSV file** window, or select a file.
5. Select **Create**.

You can now use this list in the policy builder by choosing the _in list_ operator.
