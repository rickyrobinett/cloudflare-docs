Follow this workflow to create {props.ruleName} for a given zone via API:

1. Use the [List zone rulesets](/api/resources/rulesets/methods/list/) operation to check if there is already a ruleset for the <code>{props.phaseName}</code> phase at the zone level.

2. If the phase ruleset does not exist, create it using the [Create a zone ruleset](/api/resources/rulesets/methods/create/) operation. In the new ruleset properties, set the following values:

   - **kind**: `zone`
   - **phase**: <code>{props.phaseName}</code>

3. Use the [Update a zone ruleset](/api/resources/rulesets/methods/update/) operation to add {props.ruleName} to the list of ruleset rules. Alternatively, include the rule in the [Create a zone ruleset](/api/resources/rulesets/methods/create/) request mentioned in the previous step.
