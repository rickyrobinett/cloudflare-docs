Stream Live supports "DVR mode" on an opt-in basis to allow viewers to rewind,
resume, and fast-forward a live broadcast. To enable DVR mode, add the
`dvrEnabled=true` query parameter to the Stream Player embed source or the HLS
manifest URL.

## Stream Player

``` html title="Stream Player embed format"
<div style="position: relative; padding-top: 56.25%;">
  <iframe
    src="https://customer-<CODE>.cloudflarestream.com/<INPUT_ID|VIDEO_ID>/iframe?dvrEnabled=true"
    style="border: none; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; width: 100%;"
    allow="accelerometer; gyroscope; autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;"
    allowfullscreen="true"
  ></iframe>
</div>
```

When DVR mode is enabled the Stream Player will:

- Show a timeline the viewer can scrub/seek, similar to watching an on-demand
  video. The timeline will automatically scale to show the growing duration of
  the broadcast while it is live.
- The "LIVE" indicator will show grey if the viewer is behind the live edge or
  red if they are watching the latest content. Clicking that indicator will jump
  forward to the live edge.
- If the viewer pauses the player, it will resume playback from that time instead
  of jumping forward to the live edge.

## HLS manifest for custom players

``` text title="HLS manifest URL format"
https://customer-<CODE>.cloudflarestream.com/<INPUT_ID|VIDEO_ID>/manifest/video.m3u8?dvrEnabled=true
```

Custom players using a DVR-capable HLS manifest may need additional
configuration to surface helpful controls or information. Refer to your player
library for additional information.

## Video ID or Input ID

Stream Live allows loading the Player or HLS manifest by Video ID or Live Input
ID. Refer to [Watch a live stream](/stream/stream-live/watch-live-stream/) for how to
retrieve these URLs and compare these options. There are additional
considerations when using DVR mode:

**Recommended:** Use DVR Mode on a Video ID URL:

- When the player loads, it will start playing the active broadcast if it is
  still live or play the recording if the broadcast has concluded.

DVR Mode on a Live Input ID URL:

- When the player loads, it will start playing the currently live broadcast if
  there is one (refer to [Live Input Status](/stream/stream-live/watch-live-stream/#live-input-status)).
- If the viewer is still watching _after the broadcast ends,_ they can continue
  to watch. However, if the player or manifest is then reloaded, it will show the
  latest broadcast or "Stream has not yet started" (`HTTP 204`). Past broadcasts
  are not available by Live Input ID.

## Known Limitations

- When using DVR Mode and a player/manifest created using a Live Input ID, the
  player may stall when trying to switch quality levels if a viewer is still
  watching after a broadcast has concluded.
- Performance may be degraded for DVR-enabled broadcasts longer than three hours.
  Manifests are limited to a maxiumum of 7,200 segments. Segment length is
  determined by the keyframe interval, also called GOP size.
- DVR Mode relies on Version 8 of the HLS manifest specification. Stream uses
  HLS Version 6 in all other contexts. HLS v8 offers extremely broad compatibility
  but may not work with certain old player libraries or older devices.
- DVR Mode is not available for DASH manifests.
