import { WranglerConfig, Type } from "~/components";

Cloudflare Queues can be configured using [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), the command-line interface for Cloudflare's Developer Platform, which includes [Workers](/workers/), [R2](/r2/), and other developer products.


Each Producer and Consumer Worker has a [Wrangler configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) that specifies environment variables, triggers, and resources, such as a queue. To enable Worker-to-resource communication, you must set up a [binding](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) in your Worker project's Wrangler file.

Use the options below to configure your queue.

:::note


Below are options for queues, refer to the Wrangler documentation for a full reference of the [Wrangler configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/).


:::

## Queue configuration
The following queue level settings can be configured using Wrangler:

```sh
$ npx run wrangler queues update --delivery-delay-secs 60 --message-retention-period-secs 3000
```

* `--delivery-delay-secs` <Type text="number" /> <Type text="optional" />
	* How long a published message is delayed for, before it is delivered to consumers.
	* Must be between 0 and 43200 (12 hours).
	* Defaults to 0.

* `--message-retention-period-secs`  <Type text="number" /> <Type text="optional" />
	* How long messages are retained on the Queue.
	* Defaults to 345600 (4 days).
	* Must be between 60 and 1209600 (14 days)

## Producer Worker configuration

A producer is a [Cloudflare Worker](/workers/) that writes to one or more queues. A producer can accept messages over HTTP, asynchronously write messages when handling requests, and/or write to a queue from within a [Durable Object](/durable-objects/). Any Worker can write to a queue.

To produce to a queue, set up a binding in your Wrangler file. These options should be used when a Worker wants to send messages to a queue.

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
[[queues.producers]]
  queue = "my-queue"
  binding = "MY_QUEUE"
```

</WranglerConfig>



* <code>queue</code> <Type text="string" />

  * The name of the queue.

* <code>binding</code> <Type text="string" />

  * The name of the binding, which is a JavaScript variable.



## Consumer Worker Configuration

To consume messages from one or more queues, set up a binding in your Wrangler file. These options should be used when a Worker wants to receive messages from a queue.



<WranglerConfig>

```toml
[[queues.consumers]]
  queue = "my-queue"
  max_batch_size = 10
  max_batch_timeout = 30
  max_retries = 10
  dead_letter_queue = "my-queue-dlq"
```

</WranglerConfig>

Refer to [Limits](/queues/platform/limits) to review the maximum values for each of these options.



* <code>queue</code> <Type text="string" />

  * The name of the queue.

* <code>max\_batch\_size</code> <Type text="number" /> <Type text="optional" />

  * The maximum number of messages allowed in each batch.
  * Defaults to `10` messages.

* <code>max\_batch\_timeout</code> <Type text="number" /> <Type text="optional" />

  * The maximum number of seconds to wait until a batch is full.
  * Defaults to `5` seconds.

* <code>max\_retries</code> <Type text="number" /> <Type text="optional" />

  * The maximum number of retries for a message, if it fails or [`retryAll()`](/queues/configuration/javascript-apis/#messagebatch) is invoked.
  * Defaults to `3` retries.

* <code>dead\_letter\_queue</code> <Type text="string" /> <Type text="optional" />

  * The name of another queue to send a message if it fails processing at least `max_retries` times.
  * If a `dead_letter_queue` is not defined, messages that repeatedly fail processing will eventually be discarded.
  * If there is no queue with the specified name, it will be created automatically.

* <code>max\_concurrency</code> <Type text="number" /> <Type text="optional" />

  * The maximum number of concurrent consumers allowed to run at once. Leaving this unset will mean that the number of invocations will scale to the [currently supported maximum](/queues/platform/limits/).
  * Refer to [Consumer concurrency](/queues/configuration/consumer-concurrency/) for more information on how consumers autoscale, particularly when messages are retried.



## Pull-based

A queue can have a HTTP-based consumer that pulls from the queue. This consumer can be any HTTP-speaking service that can communicate over the Internet. Review [Pull consumers](/queues/configuration/pull-consumers/) to learn how to configure a pull-based consumer.
