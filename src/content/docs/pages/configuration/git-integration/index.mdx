title: Git integration
---

You can connect each Cloudflare Pages project to a [GitHub](/pages/configuration/git-integration/github-integration) or [GitLab](/pages/configuration/git-integration/gitlab-integration) repository, and Cloudflare will automatically deploy your code every time you push a change to a branch.

:::note
Cloudflare Workers now also supports Git integrations to automatically build and deploy Workers from your connected Git repository. Learn more in [Workers Builds](/workers/ci-cd/builds/).
:::

When you connect a git repository to your Cloudflare Pages project, Cloudflare will also:

- **Preview deployments for custom branches**, generating preview URLs for a commit to any branch in the repository without affecting your production deployment.
- **Preview URLs in pull requests** (PRs) to the repository.
- **Build and deployment status checks** within the Git repository.
- **Skipping builds using a commit message**.

These features allow you to manage your deployments directly within GitHub or GitLab without leaving your team's regular development workflow.

:::caution[You cannot switch to Direct Upload later]
If you deploy using the Git integration, you cannot switch to [Direct Upload](/pages/get-started/direct-upload/) later. However, if you already use a Git-integrated project and do not want to trigger deployments every time you push a commit, you can [disable automatic deployments](/pages/configuration/git-integration/#disable-automatic-deployments) on all branches. Then, you can use Wrangler to deploy directly to your Pages projects and make changes to your Git repository without automatically triggering a build.

## Supported Git providers

Cloudflare supports connecting Cloudflare Pages to your GitHub and GitLab repositories. Pages does not currently support connecting self-hosted instances of GitHub or GitLab.

If you using a different Git provider (e.g. Bitbucket) or a self-hosted instance, you can start with a Direct Upload project and deploy using a CI/CD provider (e.g. GitHub Actions) with [Wrangler CLI](/pages/how-to/use-direct-upload-with-continuous-integration/).

## Add a Git integration

If you do not have a Git account linked to your Cloudflare account, you will be prompted to set up an installation to GitHub or GitLab when [connecting to Git](/pages/get-started/git-integration/) for the first time, or when adding a new Git account. Follow the prompts and authorize the Cloudflare Git integration.

You can check the following pages to see if your Git integration has been installed:

- [GitHub Applications page](https://github.com/settings/installations) (if you're in an organization, select **Switch settings context** to access your GitHub organization settings)
- [GitLab Authorized Applications page](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/applications)

For details on providing access to organization accounts, see the [GitHub](/pages/configuration/git-integration/github-integration/#organizational-access) and [GitLab](/pages/configuration/git-integration/gitlab-integration/#organizational-access) guides.

## Manage a Git integration

You can manage the Git installation associated with your repository connection by navigating to the Pages project, then going to **Settings** > **Builds** and selecting **Manage** under **Git Repository**.

This can be useful for managing repository access or troubleshooting installation issues by reinstalling. For more details, see the [GitHub](/pages/configuration/git-integration/github-integration/#managing-access) and [GitLab](/pages/configuration/git-integration/gitlab-integration/#managing-access) guides.

## Disable automatic deployments

If you are using a Git-integrated project and do not want to trigger deployments every time you push a commit, you can use [branch control](/pages/configuration/branch-build-controls/) to disable/pause builds:

1. Go to the **Settings** of your **Pages project** in the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com).
2. Navigate to **Build** > edit **Branch control** > turn off **Enable automatic production branch deployments**.
3. You can also change your Preview branch to **None (Disable automatic branch deployments)** to pause automatic preview deployments.

Then, you can use Wrangler to deploy directly to your Pages project and make changes to your Git repository without automatically triggering a build.
