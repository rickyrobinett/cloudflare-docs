## Custom error rules

Custom error rules define when a custom error gets triggered and the content that is served to visitors.

Rule parameters are the following:

- **`asset_name`** <Type text="String"/> <MetaInfo text="Optional"/>
  - The name of the [custom error asset](#custom-error-assets) you previously uploaded. The asset may include [error tokens](/rules/custom-errors/error-tokens/) that will be replaced with real values before sending the error response to the visitor.
  - A custom error rule can only reference an asset defined in the same scope as the rule (that is, in the same zone or account).
  - You must provide either the `asset_name` or the `content` parameter.
- **`content`** <Type text="String"/> <MetaInfo text="Optional"/>
  - The response body to return. It can include [error tokens](/rules/custom-errors/error-tokens/) that will be replaced with real values before sending the error response to the visitor.
  - You must provide either the `asset_name` or the `content` parameter.
  - The maximum content size is 10 KB.
- **`content_type`** <Type text="String"/> <MetaInfo text="Required"/>
  - The content type of the returned response. Must be one of the following:
    - `text/html`
    - `text/plain`
    - `application/json`
    - `text/xml`
- **`status_code`** <Type text="Integer"/> <MetaInfo text="Optional"/>
  - The HTTP status code of the response. If provided, this value will override the current response status code.
  - The status code must be between `400` and `999`.

:::caution

If you create an HTML error response, make sure the `referrer` meta tag is not present in the HTML code since it will disrupt [Cloudflare challenges](/waf/reference/cloudflare-challenges/):

```html
<meta name="referrer" (...) />
```

## Custom error assets

A custom error asset corresponds to a web resource such as an HTML web page (including any referenced images, CSS, and JavaScript code) that Cloudflare fetches and saves based on a URL you provide, to be served to visitors as an error page.

Custom error assets have the following parameters:

- **`name`** <Type text="String"/> <MetaInfo text="Required"/>
  - The name of the custom error asset.
  - Example value: `"500_error_template"`.
  - An asset name can contain the following characters:
    - Uppercase and lowercase letters (`A-Z` and `a-z`)
    - Numbers (`0-9`)
    - The underscore (`_`) character
  - The maximum length is 200 characters.
- **`description`** <Type text="String"/> <MetaInfo text="Optional"/>
  - A string describing the custom error asset.
  - Example value: `"Standard 5xx error template page"`.
- **`url`** <Type text="String"/> <MetaInfo text="Required"/>
  - The URL of the page you want Cloudflare to fetch and store, to be served later to visitors as error pages according to the configured [custom error rules](#custom-error-rules).
  - Example value: `"https://example.com/errors/500.html"`.
  - When you create or update an asset and provide a URL, Cloudflare collects any images, CSS, and JavaScript code used in the page, minifies the content, and saves it internally.
  - The content of the page at the specified URL may include [error tokens](/rules/custom-errors/error-tokens/) that will be replaced with real values before sending the error response to the visitor.
  - If you update an asset and provide the same URL, Cloudflare will fetch the URL again, along with its resources, and store it internally.
  - The maximum asset size is 1.5 MB.
