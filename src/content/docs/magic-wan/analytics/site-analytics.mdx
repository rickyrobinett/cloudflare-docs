After adding sites to your Magic WAN, the Network overview (beta) section of the dashboard provides you a summary of the connectivity status and traffic analytics for all your sites. This is a great place to start if you receive a Magic WAN alert, need to begin the troubleshooting process, or are performing routine monitoring.

Refer to [Set up a site](/magic-wan/configuration/common-settings/sites/) for more information.
