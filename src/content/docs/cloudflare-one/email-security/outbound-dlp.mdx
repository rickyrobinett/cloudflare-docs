:::note[Compatibility]
Outbound DLP is only compatible with Microsoft 365.
:::

Outbound Data Loss Prevention ensures the protection of sensitive information in outbound emails with [Cloudflare Data Loss Prevention (DLP)](/cloudflare-one/policies/data-loss-prevention/). Outbound Data Loss Prevention integrates with your inbox, and it proactively monitors your email to prevent unauthorized data leaks.

## Get started

To begin using outbound DLP, install the Cloudflare add-in in Microsoft 365:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Email Security** > **Outbound DLP**.
2. In **Protect sensitive data in outbound emails**, select **Get started**.
3. Select **Download add-in** to download the Cloudflare add-in.
4. Configure Microsoft 365 to use the Cloudflare add-in:
   1. In the [Microsoft 365 Apps admin center](https://config.office.com/), go to **Microsoft 365 Admin Center** > **Settings** > **Integrated Apps**.
   2. Select **Upload custom apps**. For the application type, choose _Office Add-in_.
   3. Select **Upload manifest file (.xml) from device**.
   4. Upload the Cloudflare add-in file.
   5. Verify and complete the wizard.
5. Confirm the Cloudflare add-in was configured in Microsoft 365.

After configuring the Cloudflare add-in in Microsoft 365, you can select **Add a policy** to create an [outbound DLP policy](#create-an-outbound-policy).

:::note
The Cloudflare add-in can take up to 24 hours to propagate after install.

## Create an outbound policy

An outbound policy allows you to control outbound email flow.

To create an outbound DLP policy:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Email Security** > **Outbound DLP**.
2. Select **Add a policy**.
3. Name your policy.
4. Build an expression to match specific email traffic. For example, you can create a policy that blocks outbound emails containing identifying numbers:

   | Selector            | Operator | Value                                                     | Logic | Action |
   | ------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------ |
   | Recipient email     | not in   | `example.com`                                             | And   | Block  |
   | Matched DLP profile | in       | _Social Security, Insurance, Tax, and Identifier Numbers_ |       |        |

5. (Optional) Choose whether to use the default block message or a custom message.
6. Select **Create policy**.

After creating your policy, you can modify or reorder your policies in **Email Security** > **Outbound DLP**.

### Selectors

| Selector            | Description                                                                                                                |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Recipient email     | The intended recipient of an outbound email.                                                                               |
| Email sender        | The user in your organization sending an email.                                                                            |
| Matched DLP profile | The [DLP profile](/cloudflare-one/policies/data-loss-prevention/dlp-profiles/) that content of an email matches upon scan. |

## DLP Assist add-in

The Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Assist add-in allows Microsoft O365 users to deploy a DLP solution for free using Cloudflare's Email Security.

To set up DLP Assist add-in:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Email Security** > **Outbound DLP**.
2. Select **View Microsoft add-in instructions** > Select **Download add-in**. This downloads a `.xml` file necessary to install the add-in on the client side.
3. Set up the add-in in Microsoft 365:
    - Log in to the [Microsoft admin panel](https://security.microsoft.com/homepage) and go to **Microsoft 365 Admin Center** > **Settings** > **Integrated Apps**.
    - Choose **Upload custom apps** and select **Office Add-in** for the application type.
    - Select **Upload manifest file (.xml) from device**.
    - Upload the Cloudflare add-in file you downloaded in step three. Then, verify and complete the wizard. It can take up to 24 hours for an add-in to propagate.

The add-in works by inserting headers into the [EML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EML) on the client side before the message is sent out. 

To block, encrypt, or send approval, you can configure rules within Microsoft Purview DLP:

1. Go to [Microsoft Purview](https://purview.microsoft.com/datalossprevention/overview?tid=11648e1c-3d60-40e2-bf07-f8d481e48e2d).
2. Select **Policies** > **Create policy**.
3. Do not choose any templates or custom policy. Select **Next**.
4. Choose a name and description for the policy: You can choose any name. However, this guide will use `Cloudflare Assist Block`.
5. Select **Next** on **Admin Units**:
    - Choose to only apply to **Exchange Email**.
    - Choose **Create or customize advanced DLP Rules**.
6. Select **Create rule**:
    - Create a policy name.
    - Add the following conditions:
        - **Header contains words or phrases**: `Key: cf_outbound_dlp with Value: BLOCK`
        - Select **AND**.
        - **Content is shared from Microsoft 365**: Select **with people from outside my organization**.
7. Under **Actions**, the admin can choose what to do with the message. You can use the **Restrict access or encrypt the content in Microsoft 365 locations** to block the message or encrypt it.
8. Under **User notifications**, turn on notifications. Admins can also edit the message if they want to. You can also configure if the admin wants to receive a notification under **Incident reports** >  **Use this severity level in admin alerts and reports**.
9. Select **Save**.
10. Select **Turn the Policy On Immediately**.
