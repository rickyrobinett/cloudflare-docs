Directories are folders to store user data. Email Security allows you to manage directories from the Cloudflare dashboard.

To add a directory:

1. Log in to [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Select **Email security**.
3. Select **Directories**.
4. Select **Add a directory** > **Manage integrations**.
5. On the SaaS integrations page, select **Add integration**.

To sync a directory, select the three dots, then select **Sync now**.

:::note
The **Auto sync** option is on by default. It is recommended to keep this option on at all times to ensure directories are always synchronized.
