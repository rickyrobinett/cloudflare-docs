AI Gateway is available to use on all plans.

AI Gateway's core features available today are offered for free, and all it takes is a Cloudflare account and one line of code to [get started](/ai-gateway/get-started/). Core features include: dashboard analytics, caching, and rate limiting.

We will continue to build and expand AI Gateway. Some new features may be additional core features that will be free while others may be part of a premium plan. We will announce these as they become available.

You can monitor your usage in the AI Gateway dashboard.

## Persistent logs (Beta)

:::note[Note]

Billing for persistent logs has not yet started. Users on paid plans can store logs beyond the included volume of 200,000 logs stored a month without being charged during this period. (Users on the free plan remain limited to the 100,000 logs cap for their plan.) We will provide plenty of advanced notice before charging begins for persistent log storage. 

:::

Persistent logs are available on all plans, with a free allocation for both free and paid plans. Charges for additional logs beyond those limits are based on the number of logs stored per month.

### Free allocation and overage pricing

| Plan         | Free logs stored   | Overage pricing                      |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Workers Free | 100,000 logs total | N/A â€“ Upgrade to Workers Paid        |
| Workers Paid | 200,000 logs total | $8 per 100,000 logs stored per month |

Allocations are based on the total logs stored across all gateways. If your limit is reached, new logs will stop being saved. To continue saving logs, you must [delete logs](/ai-gateway/observability/logging/#how-to-delete-logs/) to free up space. 

## Logpush

Logpush is only available on the Workers Paid plan.

|          | Paid plan                          |
