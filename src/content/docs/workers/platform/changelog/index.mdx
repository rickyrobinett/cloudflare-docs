import { ProductReleaseNotes } from "~/components";

This changelog details meaningful changes made to Workers across the Cloudflare dashboard, Wrangler, the API, and the workerd runtime. These changes are not configurable.

This is *different* from [compatibility dates](/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/) and [compatibility flags](/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/), which let you explicitly opt-in to or opt-out of specific changes to the Workers Runtime.
