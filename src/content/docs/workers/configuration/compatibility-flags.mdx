description: Opt into a specific features of the Workers runtime for your Workers project.

import { CompatibilityFlags, WranglerConfig, Render } from "~/components";

Compatibility flags enable specific features. They can be useful if you want to help the Workers team test upcoming changes that are not yet enabled by default, or if you need to hold back a change that your code depends on but still want to apply other compatibility changes.

Compatibility flags will often have a date in which they are enabled by default, and so, by specifying a [`compatibility_date`](/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates) for your Worker, you can quickly enable all of these various compatibility flags up to, and including, that date.

## Setting compatibility flags

You may provide a list of `compatibility_flags`, which enable or disable specific changes.

#### Via Wrangler

Compatibility flags can be set in a Worker's [Wrangler configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/).

This example enables the specific flag `formdata_parser_supports_files`, which is described [below](/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#formdata-parsing-supports-file). As of the specified date, `2021-09-14`, this particular flag was not yet enabled by default, but, by specifying it in `compatibility_flags`, we can enable it anyway. `compatibility_flags` can also be used to disable changes that became the default in the past.

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
# Opt into backwards-incompatible changes through September 14, 2021.
compatibility_date = "2021-09-14"
# Also opt into an upcoming fix to the FormData API.
compatibility_flags = [ "formdata_parser_supports_files" ]
```

</WranglerConfig>

#### Via the Cloudflare Dashboard

Compatibility flags can be updated in the Workers settings on the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).

#### Via the Cloudflare API

Compatibility flags can be set when uploading a Worker using the [Workers Script API](/api/resources/workers/subresources/scripts/methods/update/) or [Workers Versions API](/api/resources/workers/subresources/scripts/subresources/versions/methods/create/) in the request body's `metadata` field.

## Node.js compatibility flag

:::note
[The `nodejs_compat` flag](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) also enables `nodejs_compat_v2` as long as your compatibility date is 2024-09-23 or later. The v2 flag improves runtime Node.js compatibility by bundling additional polyfills and globals into your Worker. However, this improvement increases bundle size.

If your compatibility date is 2024-09-22 or before and you want to enable v2, add the `nodejs_compat_v2` in addition to the `nodejs_compat` flag.
If your compatibility date is after 2024-09-23, but you want to disable v2 to avoid increasing your bundle size, add the `no_nodejs_compat_v2` in addition to the `nodejs_compat flag`.
:::

A [growing subset](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) of Node.js APIs are available directly as [Runtime APIs](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs), with no need to add polyfills to your own code. To enable these APIs in your Worker, add the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag to your [Wrangler configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

<Render file="nodejs_compat" product="workers" />

A [growing subset](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) of Node.js APIs are available directly as [Runtime APIs](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs), with no need to add polyfills to your own code. To enable these APIs in your Worker, only the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag is required:

<WranglerConfig>

```toml title="wrangler.toml"
compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat" ]
```

</WranglerConfig>

As additional Node.js APIs are added, they will be made available under the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag. Unlike most other compatibility flags, we do not expect the `nodejs_compat` to become active by default at a future date.

The Node.js `AsyncLocalStorage` API is a particularly useful feature for Workers. To enable only the `AsyncLocalStorage` API, use the `nodejs_als` compatibility flag.

<WranglerConfig>

```toml title="wrangler.toml"
compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_als" ]
```

</WranglerConfig>

## Flags history

Newest flags are listed first.

## Experimental flags

These flags can be enabled via `compatibility_flags`, but are not yet scheduled to become default on any particular date.
