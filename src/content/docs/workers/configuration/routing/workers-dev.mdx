Cloudflare Workers accounts come with a `workers.dev` subdomain that is configurable in the Cloudflare dashboard. Your `workers.dev` subdomain allows you getting started quickly by deploying Workers without first onboarding your custom domain to Cloudflare.

It's recommended to run production Workers on a [Workers route or custom domain](/workers/configuration/routing/), rather than on your `workers.dev` subdomain. Your `workers.dev` subdomain is treated as a [Free website](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/) and is intended for personal or hobby projects that aren't business-critical.

## Configure `workers.dev`

`workers.dev` subdomains take the format: `<YOUR_ACCOUNT_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev`. To change your `workers.dev` subdomain:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
2. Select **Workers & Pages**.
3. Select **Change** next to **Your subdomain**.

All Workers are assigned a `workers.dev` route when they are created or renamed following the syntax `<YOUR_WORKER_NAME>.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev`. The [`name`](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#inheritable-keys) field in your Worker configuration is used as the subdomain for the deployed Worker.

## Disabling `workers.dev`

### Disabling `workers.dev` in the dashboard

To disable the `workers.dev` route for a Worker:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
2. Go to **Workers & Pages** and in **Overview**, select your Worker.
3. Go to **Settings** > **Domains & Routes**.
4. On `workers.dev` click "Disable".
5. Confirm you want to disable.

### Disabling `workers.dev` in the Wrangler configuration file

To disable the `workers.dev` route for a Worker, include the following in your Worker's  [Wrangler configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
workers_dev = false
```

</WranglerConfig>

When you redeploy your Worker with this change, the `workers.dev` route will be disabled. Disabling your `workers.dev` route does not disable Preview URLs. Learn how to [disable Preview URLs](/workers/configuration/previews/#disabling-preview-urls).

If you do not specify `workers_dev = false` but add a [`routes` component](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#routes) to your [Wrangler configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/), the value of `workers_dev` will be inferred as `false` on the next deploy.

:::caution

If you disable your `workers.dev` route in the Cloudflare dashboard but do not update your Worker's Wrangler file with `workers_dev = false`, the `workers.dev` route will be re-enabled the next time you deploy your Worker with Wrangler.
