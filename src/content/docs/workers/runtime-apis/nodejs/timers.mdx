Use [`node:timers`](https://nodejs.org/api/timers.html) APIs to schedule functions to be executed later.

This includes [`setTimeout`](https://nodejs.org/api/timers.html#settimeoutcallback-delay-args) for calling a function after a delay,
[`setInterval`](https://nodejs.org/api/timers.html#clearintervaltimeout) for calling a function repeatedly,
and [`setImmediate`](https://nodejs.org/api/timers.html#setimmediatecallback-args) for calling a function in the next iteration of the event loop.

<TypeScriptExample filename="index.ts">
```ts
import timers from "node:timers";

console.log("first");
timers.setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("last");
}, 10);

timers.setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("next");
});
```
</TypeScriptExample>

:::note
Due to [security-based restrictions on timers](/workers/reference/security-model/#step-1-disallow-timers-and-multi-threading) in Workers,
timers are limited to returning the time of the last I/O. This means that while setTimeout, setInterval, and setImmediate will defer your function execution
until after other events have run, they will not delay them for the full time specified.
:::

:::note
When called from a global level (on [`globalThis`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/globalThis)),
functions such as `clearTimeout` and `setTimeout` will respect web standards rather than Node.js-specific functionality. For complete Node.js
compatibility, you must call functions from the `node:timers` module.
:::

The full `node:timers` API is documented in the [Node.js documentation for `node:timers`](https://nodejs.org/api/timers.html).
