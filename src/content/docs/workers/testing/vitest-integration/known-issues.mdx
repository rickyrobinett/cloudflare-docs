description: Explore the known issues associated with the Workers Vitest integration.

---

The Workers Vitest pool is currently in open beta. The following are issues Cloudflare is aware of and fixing:

### Coverage

Native code coverage via [V8](https://v8.dev/blog/javascript-code-coverage) is not supported. You must use instrumented code coverage via [Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/) instead. Refer to the [Vitest Coverage documentation](https://vitest.dev/guide/coverage) for setup instructions.

### Fake timers

Vitest's [fake timers](https://vitest.dev/guide/mocking.html#timers) do not apply to KV, R2 and cache simulators. For example, you cannot expire a KV key by advancing fake time.

### Dynamic `import()` statements with `SELF` and Durable Objects

Dynamic `import()` statements do not work inside `export default { ... }` handlers when writing integration tests with `SELF`, or inside Durable Object event handlers. You must import and call your handlers directly, or use static `import` statements in the global scope.

### Durable Object alarms

Durable Object alarms are not reset between test runs and do not respect isolated storage. Ensure you delete or run all alarms with [`runDurableObjectAlarm()`](/workers/testing/vitest-integration/test-apis/#durable-objects) scheduled in each test before finishing the test.

### Durable Objects and `isolatedStorage`

Using WebSockets with Durable Objects with the [`isolatedStorage`](/workers/testing/vitest-integration/isolation-and-concurrency) flag turned on is not supported. You must set `isolatedStorage: false` in your `vitest.config.ts` file.

### Returning non-primitive values from RPC methods

In order to return non-primitive values (objects or classes extending `RpcTarget`, for instance) from RPC methods, you must use the `using` keyword. Refer to [https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/rpc/lifecycle#explicit-resource-management](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/rpc/lifecycle#explicit-resource-management) for more details. An [example test](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/fixtures/vitest-pool-workers-examples/rpc/test/unit.test.ts#L155) is included in the `workers-sdk` repository.

### Module resolution

If you encounter module resolution issues such as: `Error: Cannot use require() to import an ES Module` or `Error: No such module`, you can bundle these dependencies using the [deps.optimizer](https://vitest.dev/config/#deps-optimizer) option:

```tsx
import { defineWorkersConfig } from "@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers/config";

export default defineWorkersConfig({
	test: {
		deps: {
			optimizer: {
				ssr: {
					enabled: true,
					include: ["your-package-name"],
				},
			},
		},
		poolOptions: {
			workers: {
				// ...
			},
		},
	},
});
```

You can find an example in the [Recipes](/workers/testing/vitest-integration/recipes) page.

### Importing modules from global setup file

Although Vitest is set up to resolve packages for the `workerd` runtime, it runs your global setup file in the Node.js environment. This can cause issues when importing packages like [Postgres.js](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/6465), which exports a non-Node version for `workerd`.
To work around this, you can create a wrapper that uses Vite's SSR module loader to import the global setup file under the correct conditions. Then, adjust your Vitest configuration to point to this wrapper. For example:

```ts
// File: global-setup-wrapper.ts
import { createServer } from "vite"

// Import the actual global setup file with the correct setup
const mod = await viteImport("./global-setup.ts")

export default mod.default;

// Helper to import the file with default node setup
async function viteImport(file: string) {
  const server = await createServer({
    root: import.meta.dirname,
    configFile: false,
    server: { middlewareMode: true, hmr: false, watch: null, ws: false },
    optimizeDeps: { noDiscovery: true },
    clearScreen: false,
  });
  const mod = await server.ssrLoadModule(file);
  await server.close();
  return mod;
}
```

```ts
// File: vitest.config.ts
import { defineWorkersConfig } from "@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers/config";

export default defineWorkersConfig({
	test: {
		// Replace the globalSetup with the wrapper file
		globalSetup: ["./global-setup-wrapper.ts"],
		poolOptions: {
			workers: {
				// ...
			},
		},
	},
});
```
