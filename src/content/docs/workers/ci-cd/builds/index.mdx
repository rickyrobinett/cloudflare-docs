Workers Builds allows you to connect an _existing Worker_ to its GitHub or GitLab repository, enabling automated builds and deployments for your project on push.

Support for creating a _new Worker_ from importing a Git repository is coming soon.

## Get started

If you have an existing Worker and have pushed the project to a Git repository, you can now connect the repository to your Worker, enabling automatic builds and deployments.

To set up builds for your Worker:

1. Select your Worker in the [Workers & Pages Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and navigate to **Settings > Build**.
2. Select the Git provider you would like to connect to or select **Connect** and follow the prompts to install the Cloudflare [Git integration](/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/) on your Git account.
3. Configure your [build settings](/workers/ci-cd/builds/configuration/) by selecting your desired Git repository, branch, and configure commands for your build.
4. Push a commit to your Git repository to trigger a build and deploy for your Worker.

:::caution

When connecting a repository to a Workers project, the Worker name in the Cloudflare dashboard must match the `name` in the wrangler.toml file in the specified root directory, or the build will fail. This ensures that the Worker deployed from the repository is consistent with the Worker registered in the Cloudflare dashboard. For details, see [Workers name requirement](/workers/ci-cd/builds/troubleshoot/#workers-name-requirement).

## View build and preview URL

You can monitor a build's status and its build logs by navigating to **View build history** at the bottom of the **Deployments** tab of your Worker.

If the build is successful, you can view the build details by selecting **View build** in the associated new [version](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/) created under Version History. There you will also find the [preview URL](/workers/configuration/previews/) generated by the version under Version ID.

:::note[Builds, versions, deployments]

If a build succeeds, it is uploaded as a version. If the build is configured to deploy (for example, with `wrangler deploy` set as the deploy command), the uploaded version will be automatically promoted to the Active Deployment.

## Disconnecting builds

To disable automatic builds and deployments from your Git repository, go to **Settings** > **Builds** and select **Disconnect** under **Git Repositories**. If you want to switch to a different repository for your Worker, you must first disable builds, then reconnect to select the new repository.

To disable automatic deployments while still allowing builds to run automatically and save as [versions](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/) (without promoting them to an active deployment), update your deploy command to: `npx wrangler versions upload`.
