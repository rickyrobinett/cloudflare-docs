This example shows you how to connect Hyperdrive to a Digital Ocean database instance.

## 1. Allow Hyperdrive access

To allow Hyperdrive to connect to your database, you will need to ensure that Hyperdrive has valid user credentials and network access.

### DigitalOcean Dashboard

1. Go to the DigitalOcean dashboard and select the database you wish to connect to.
2. Go to the **Overview** tab.
3. Under the **Connection Details** panel, select **Public network**.
4. On the dropdown menu, select **Connection string** > **show-password**.
5. Copy the connection string.

With the connection string, you can now create a Hyperdrive database configuration.

## 2. Create a database configuration

<Render file="create-hyperdrive-config" />

If you see a DNS-related error, it is possible that the DNS for your vendor's database has not yet been propagated. Try waiting 10 minutes before retrying the operation.
